Working on:

TODO:
* Make unCaching of mocha tests more efficient
* Make types of mutations configurable
* Get rid of some dependencies
* Speedup tests
* Better Documentation
* Document or fix non terminating loops introduced by mutations
--> Workaround created for Karma
--> Still an issue with Mocha
* Cleanup and Refactor Code


Done:
* Fix non-terminating loops introduced by mutations (for Karma)
* fix multiple mocha mutation tests targets for same files bug
* Don't check mutations which are part of untested mutations (optional)
* Untested "Mutate Function Argument" Mutations should get better log message
* Configuration of ignored replacements (e.g. to avoid replacements with _, console)
* "Mutate Function Argument" mutations should keep data type for literals
* Add "Mutate Literals (Number, String, Boolean)" mutations
* Add "Remove Function Call" mutations
* Add "Remove Array Item" mutations
* Make timeout at startup of karma configurable
* Add "Mutate Function Argument" mutations
* Add "Remove Attribute" (in Object Literals) mutations
* Integrate mocha mutation testing (easy configuration)
* Make Karma better configurable
* Add statistics
* Configure multiple ignore patterns in a config file
* Stop Karma (including PhantomJS) in a nice way
* Karma mutation testing (easy configuration)
* At Start run tests without any mutation to test if the test succeeds
* Deploy on npm
* Add CI on Travis
* Tests should work on other computers
